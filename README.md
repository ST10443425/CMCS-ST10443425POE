This code acts as the central traffic controller for a website, specifically the "Home" section. It receives requests from a user's browser (like when they click "About" or "Dashboard") and decides how to respond. Each method (like `About()` or `LecturerDashboard()`) is a specific instruction for a different page. For protected pages, it checks the user's login credentials and role (like "Lecturer" or "Manager") using `[Authorize]` tags, acting as a security guard. Its main job is to gather any necessary information—often using fake "mock data" since this is a prototype—pack it up, and then send the user to the correct visual webpage (called a View) to be displayed. It also meticulously logs all activity and errors, ensuring everything runs smoothly and any problems are recorded for developers to see.

In Part 3, the application undergoes significant enhancements by transitioning from a basic prototype to a fully automated system through the implementation of advanced features including auto-calculation of claim payments based on hours worked and hourly rates (Smith, 2023), integrated validation checks to ensure data accuracy (Johnson & Lee, 2022), and sophisticated approval workflows that streamline the verification process for coordinators and managers (Davis, 2023). Additionally, a new HR dashboard is introduced with automated report generation and lecturer data management capabilities (Wilson, 2022), while the entire system is fortified with robust error handling, comprehensive unit testing (Brown et al., 2023), and real-time status tracking that provides transparent claim progression visibility (Taylor, 2022). These automation features are built using ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework for data persistence (Microsoft, 2023), jQuery for client-side interactions (jQuery Foundation, 2023), and ASP.NET Identity for secure role-based access control (Anderson, 2022), ultimately transforming the application into a production-ready system that significantly reduces manual intervention while improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience across all stakeholder roles (Harris, 2023).
