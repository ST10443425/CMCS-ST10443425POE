This code acts as the central traffic controller for a website, specifically the "Home" section. It receives requests from a user's browser (like when they click "About" or "Dashboard") and decides how to respond. Each method (like `About()` or `LecturerDashboard()`) is a specific instruction for a different page. For protected pages, it checks the user's login credentials and role (like "Lecturer" or "Manager") using `[Authorize]` tags, acting as a security guard. Its main job is to gather any necessary information—often using fake "mock data" since this is a prototype—pack it up, and then send the user to the correct visual webpage (called a View) to be displayed. It also meticulously logs all activity and errors, ensuring everything runs smoothly and any problems are recorded for developers to see.
